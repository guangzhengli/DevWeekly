# Introduction

Plane is an open-source, self-hosted project planning tool that helps manage issues, sprints and product roadmaps. It offers a rich text editor for creating issues with sub-properties and references to improve organisation and tracking. The software also allows users to attach files to issues for better collaboration, customise their project view with layouts such as List, Kanban or Calendar views, plan sprints with Cycles using burn-down charts and other features to track progress. Plane pages function as an AI-powered notepad allowing users to document issue details easily while the Command + K menu provides easy navigation through projects from one convenient location. Users can sync GitHub issues with Plane for streamlined planning processes.

Facebook AI Research has released Fairseq, a sequence modelling toolkit that enables developers and researchers to train custom models for text generation tasks such as summarisation, language modelling and translation. The platform also offers pre-trained models for these tasks with a torch.hub interface. The MIT-licensed system includes instructions on getting started, training new models and extending fairseq with new model types and tasks.

Tinygrad is a deep learning framework that aims to be the easiest to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training. Due to its extreme simplicity, it supports basic operations and provides SOTA vision models/efficientnet.py and language models/transformer.py models. The project is maintained by tiny corp. It currently supports GPUs through PyOpenCL but work is being done on supporting Apple Neural Engine and Google TPU in the accel/folder.

InternGPT is an open-source demo platform that allows users to showcase their AI models. It supports various features such as DragGAN, ChatGPT, ImageBind, multimodal chat like GPT-4, SAM, interactive image editing and more. InternGPT is a pointing-language-driven visual interactive system that enables users to interact with ChatGPT by clicking, dragging and drawing using a pointing device. The system significantly improves the efficiency of communication between users and chatbots by incorporating pointing instructions in complicated visual scenarios. Additionally, it uses an auxiliary control mechanism to improve the control capability of LLM and fine-tunes a large vision-language model termed Husky for high-quality multi-modal dialogue (impressing ChatGPT-3.5-turbo with 93.89% GPT-4 Quality).

The JSON Meta Application Protocol Specification (JMAP) is a new protocol designed to make more efficient use of network resources and be easier for developers to work with. It aims to become the best open standard protocol for email, based on years of experience at Fastmail and talking to other major MUA/MTA developers. JMAP has several attributes that help achieve these goals, including being stateless, having immutable IDs that are not intended to be user visible, providing flood control and allowing clients to efficiently fetch updates from their current state. The data model is backward compatible with both IMAP folders and Gmail-style labels. There are also essentially complete specifications for calendaring and contacts via JMAP.

Taschen has released a new book, The Computer: A history from the 17th Century to Today, which explores the visual and cultural history of computing. Edited by graphic designers Jens MÃ¼ller and Julius Wiedemann, the XL-scale book covers everything from mechanical precursors to modern-day devices such as drones and robots. It also includes archive images of early computer designs alongside illustrated sidetracks into advertising, media coverage and speculative research for each era. The book is presented in Taschen's trilingual style with an ongoing glossary of computing language and profiles of pioneering men and women who shaped the industry.

CSS Pro is a browser extension that allows users to make changes to any website's design without writing CSS code. The visual editor generates the code for users, allowing them to experiment with CSS in a visual way and easily test their ideas. Users can edit any website, even if it's not theirs, and pick colors using tints and shades in real-time or change color syntaxes such as HEX to RGB in seconds. The tool also enables users to try over 1,500 fonts including all Google Fonts, system and custom fonts. Additionally, developers can switch to the Code Editor anytime to check or edit CSS by code with color pickers that make changing colors easier.
