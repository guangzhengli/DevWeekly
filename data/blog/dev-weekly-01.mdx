# Introduction

A sample post with markdown.
Microsoft has released a new guidance language called Guidance, which allows users to control large language models (LLMs) more effectively and efficiently than traditional prompting or chaining. The program enables interleaving of generation, prompting, and logical control into a single continuous flow that matches how the LLM processes text. It also supports simple output structures like Chain of Thought and its many variants to improve LLM performance. Additionally, it offers rich output structure with multiple generations, selections, conditionals, tool use etc., making it easier for users to integrate Hugging Face models.

PrivateGPT is a tool that allows users to interact with their documents privately using the power of GPT. The tool enables users to ask questions without an internet connection, and no data leaves the execution environment at any point. PrivateGPT uses LangChain, GPT4All, LlamaCpp, Chroma and SentenceTransformers for its operations. Users can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection by setting up their environment and installing all requirements. The script also supports optional command-line arguments to modify its behavior. However, it is not production-ready but meant for testing purposes only.

DataTalks.Club is offering a free MLOps course called MLOps Zoomcamp, which aims to teach practical aspects of productionizing ML services from training and experimenting to model deployment and monitoring. The course is aimed at data scientists, ML engineers, software engineers, and data engineers interested in learning about putting ML into production. The materials are freely available for self-paced learning with suggested syllabus week by week. The course includes six modules covering topics such as experiment tracking and model management, orchestration and ML pipelines, model deployment (online/offline), best practices testing (unit/integration), infrastructure as code (Terraform) among others.

DB-GPT is an experimental open-source project that uses localized GPT large models to interact with data and environment. The solution supports local deployment, allowing it to be applied in independent private environments and isolated according to business modules, ensuring the ability of large models is absolutely private, secure, and controllable. It features SQL language capabilities, SQL generation; diagnosis, Private domain Q&A and data processing, Database knowledge Q&A Data processing Plugins Support custom plugin execution tasks natively supporting Auto-GPT plugins such as automatic execution of SQL and retrieval of query results.

Sniffnet is a free, open-source software that allows users to monitor their internet traffic. It features a graphical interface with real-time charts and statistics about network activity, as well as the ability to apply filters and set custom notifications for specific events. Sniffnet also provides information about domain names, network providers, and IP geolocation of remote hosts. The application can be installed on Windows, macOS, or Linux systems through various methods such as GitHub releases or Homebrew packages. Users are encouraged to donate to support the development and maintenance of Sniffnet.

yt-fts is a Python script that uses yt-dlp to scrape all of a YouTube channel's subtitles and load them into an SQLite database that can be searched from the command line. It allows users to query a channel for specific keywords or phrases and generates time-stamped YouTube URLs to the video containing the keyword. The tool requires yt-dlp installed globally, and platform-specific installation instructions are available on the yt-dlp wiki. Users can download all of a channel's VTT files into their database, specify subtitle language, speed up downloads with multi-threading, list downloaded channels, search for text based on channel ID given by user input, export search results to CSV format with headers Video Title, Quote, Time Stamp and Link as well as delete channels from their database using this tool.

Progress is a Linux tool that displays the percentage of copied data for coreutils basic commands, such as cp, mv and dd. It can also show estimated time and throughput, and provides a "top-like" mode (monitoring). Progress works on Linux, FreeBSD and macOS. The tool was formerly known as Coreutils Viewer (cv) but has since been renamed.

Google has released a multi-day Rust course, Comprehensive Rust, which covers all aspects of the programming language from basic syntax to concurrency. The course was developed by Google's Android team and is used internally when teaching experienced software engineers who have a background in C++ or Java. While it is less useful for self-study, the course can be accessed online and includes deep dives on Android, bare-metal and error handling.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released the first beta version of PostgreSQL 16, which includes performance improvements in query execution, logical replication enhancements, developer experience features such as support for SQL/JSON standard and non-decimal integer literals. The release also adds security-oriented connection parameters for clients and several new monitoring features. Users are encouraged to test the new features on their systems to help eliminate bugs or other issues that may exist before its general availability later this year.
